# Python_library_management_using_text_file
This is a project done for the coursework assigned by my college. Here, a system has been created where a list of book details is read and displayed to user. There are options to display the book lits, borrow books, return books and to exit from the system. The user selected book is checked for availability. If the book is available, the user's name is asked and a file named after the user is created where the details such as the user's name, book borrowede, time and date borrowed is stored. If this is returning user, the book borrow or returning process is continued, else it is asked to user to create a new username. If this is the returning user, the returning process is continued.
