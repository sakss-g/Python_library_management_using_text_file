# Python_library_management_using_text_file
This is a project done for the coursework assigned by my college. Here, a system has been created where a list of book details is read and displayed to user. There are options to display the book list, borrow books, return books and to exit from the system. The user selected book is checked for availability. If the book is available, the user's name is asked and a txt file named after the user is created where the details such as the user's name, book borrowed, time and date borrowed is stored. If this is the returning user, the returning process is continued and a similar txt file is created.
